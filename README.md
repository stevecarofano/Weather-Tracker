# Weather-Tracker


## Description

* I wanted to create an easy to use Weather App to display a 5-day forecast for any city using APIs

* The temperature (in fahrenheit) and humidity will display along with a picture icon indicating the weather for the next 5 days

* It was a challenge to work alongside the API and generate the proper HTML elements to display the information

* In the future I'd like to implement more details regarding the weather such as precipitation chance and heat index
